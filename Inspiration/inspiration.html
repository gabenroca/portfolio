        <p>Known for his distinctive style that blends gothic and whimsical elements, Tim Burton successfully creates a dream fantasy world that stays true to his artistic vision.<br> His ability to capture and master such dark yet beautiful visuals in a way that is easily recognizable is a testament to his unique, rare talent.<br> I would love to get to a point in my life and career where I can continously create art that is true to me especially having the freedom to express that in different mediums.</p>

        <p>The American rock band, Paramore is composed of the talented Hayley Williams, Taylor York, and Zac Farro.<br> Paramore has been my favoriye band of all time because their music brings out all the emotions: angst, misery, joy, and especially the feeling of being alive.<br> Their lyrics, sound, and who they are as gtenuine people inspire me to be the best version of myself in my passions.<br> Altogether, they remind me how vulnerbility and goodness only makes us stronger and capable.</p>

        <p>Popular artist and activist, Keith Haring, was part of a legendary New York art scene during the 1980s.<br> Growing up, I saw his artwork quite frequently and was automatically drawn to his colorful, bold, and playful appearance.<br> As I got older, I became evem more appreciative of his work because of how they responded to contemporary social and political events.<br> I am moved by his creations because of it is powerful purpose alongside its striking visuals.<br> Keith Haring inspires me to beep creating art especially to paint a message that is important to me and what I believe in.</p>
